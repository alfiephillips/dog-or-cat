# Machine Learning Project: Linear Regression and Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and analyzing two core algorithms in machine learning: linear regression and classification. The goal is to predict outcomes based on input data using these models, providing insights into different datasets.

## Features
- **Linear Regression**: Implements a linear regression model to predict continuous outcomes based on input features.
- **Classification Algorithm**: Utilizes a classification model (specify algorithm, e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) to categorize data into distinct classes.
